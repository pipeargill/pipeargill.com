6PM
I've had a fairly productive day so far. Started working on setting up my Kubuntu server as a "secure gateway", but I'm waiting on a duplicate finder to finish analyzing my data before I actually start making changes on the server. I decided to see if I can use a DCMA takedown a scam account on BlueSky that stole an old profile picture I was using for one of my accounts. 
We missed trash pickup again, so tomorrow the plan is to take a trailer load of trash to the dump. Been doing more house cleanup to get ready for that.

9:30PM
Feeling sort of strange today, listless 

10PM 
So I ended up just installing Picasa 3.9 because I loved using it for editing back in the day and I don't want anything very complicated. I'm also going to try PhotoPad.

I'm punting the photo a day thing a bit again today, but here's a photo of one of my cats that actually was taken today.
