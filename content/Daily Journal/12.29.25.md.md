I ended up waking up around 9AM today, put my daily caffeine cans into the freezer then laid down on the couch. After a while of watch youtube junk I went back to bed and slept in/bed rotted until like 3PM. Thankfully someone removed my cans before they exploded in the freezer. I feel like I'm real dependent on caffeine, but it's like my last vice and I really don't feel like giving that up yet. I'm probably definitely real depressed still.

I'm back to working on my homelab stuff. I decided to install Kubuntu LTS to replace CachyOS on my server because I'm more familiar with Debian based than Arch based and I feel like documentation/support is less esoteric. Works, love it so far. I'm setting up Resilio Sync to handle NAS (Network Attached Storage) Resilio Sync is sort of like a self hosted Dropbox without a subscription or a "cloud"/centralized server. I love it because I used to use it instead of Dropbox back when it was Bittorrent Sync, it has a free license for personal use.

9:30PM

I have my Resilio NAS set up! Took a bit of configuring in Linux, because obviously I have to do that, but I'm excited to finally have my drives connected and networked.

10PM

Ok, this is really really cool! I just figured out that my Toshiba FlashAir W-03 SD card allows my computer to access the internet THROUGH it! I originally used the setup utility to configure the card while I was installing Magic Lantern on my Canon T5 and while I did I configured it to connect to my WiFi and to broadcast it's own. Apparently it does both at the same time and can connect whatever device is connected to it to the network it is connected to! This is really big because I've been looking to use my Android phone to automatically send images to my server and this potentially simplifies the process as long as I can configure the FlashAir to connect to a pocket hotspot.

I didn't actually take any pictures today, but here are a few I want to publish anyway. So far I'm just pushing unedited photos, but I may explore editors I can tolerate. I don't think I want to go full Lightroom because Adobe can go die, but I might see if I can use a pre-Google copy of Picasa or something.
