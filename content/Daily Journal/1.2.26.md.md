It's been a pretty okay day. We made an attempt at taking the trash to the dump, but they closed just before we got there and we ended up turning around and planning for tomorrow.

Been pretty excited about a project that I was to experiment with using concrete. Picked up some supplies for that, will make a post about it soon.

It is cold, but I went out and got some pictures of the town square while lights are still up. They've started taking down the Christmas stuff, but that's okay. I like some lights, but a lot of that stuff is too much for my tastes. That said this town is pretty mild compared to others I've seen. Not even any of those awful blue LEDs.

Going to try to get to bed early tonight because I have to be up early to actually get the trash to the dump. Hopefully we can also get that Sony CRT I found on marketplace before the holidays and bad weather hit, will have to see if the seller is available.
