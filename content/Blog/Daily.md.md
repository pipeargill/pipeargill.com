2PM First note, this journal is personal thoughts. Planning to maintain as part of mindfulness practice.

It's finally snowing. First rain, then ice, now there are big fluffily flakes of white.

6PM I decided to move my servers/gaming PC up to the old broken staircase. There's a few weak/broken steps, so a server closet seems like a better use. It has a really high ceiling, so I may try hoisting my mountain bike up in it too.

I still feel lost and anti-social. I'm hopeful that actually beginning to organize my mind will help. I dream now and I really hate that. I find them bothersome and they often make me sad because I pine after people that I don't think I should. But having them is probably healthy. I recentlyish stopped using THC altogether and started a ketogenic diet again, but for mental health this time. I'm hesitant to mention because I'm not sure how professional this site may end up becoming, but I figure the people I might worry about physical harm from can't read and the data collection robots already know, so transparency in obscurity I suppose. I found an opportunity to start HRT, at least for a while and I'm really enjoying the change in chemistry so far. I'm sure there is overlay between that, keto, and dropping weed, but I feel like these are all good changes in my life. I know that fully transitioning isn't my plan, but I really enjoy existing in a non-binary, and twink-death is really scary to me right now as I stare down 34.
